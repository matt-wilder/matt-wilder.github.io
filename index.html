  Hello world! Welcome to my personal website. I’m a political economy and public policy specialist whose research deals with governance surrounding innovation and equitable growth. These days, my attention is focused mostly on policy in support of ‘just transitions’ toward sustainable economic development, specifically as it relates to innovation in energy, transportation and agriculture. I previously obtained a PhD in political science from the University of Toronto, where I examined Canadian industrial policy through a comparative lens. I then went on to do a Visiting Fellowship in the Department of Government at Harvard, where I analyzed international knowledge flows based on patent text using natural language processing. I currently hold a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Toronto, and am on the job market for an academic post in political economy and/or public policy. Please check out my CV, research items and teaching materials. Don’t be shy to get in touch via e-mail, or to add me on LinkedIn or Twitter.
